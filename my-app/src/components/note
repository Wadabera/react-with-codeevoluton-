✅ WHAT IS A COMPONENT IN GENERAL?
In React, a Component is like a reusable block that builds your UI.

Example:

A button is a component.

A user profile is a component.

A chat message is a component.

Now let's talk about the two types:

🔸 Component – Normal Component
💡 What is it?
A normal React class component.

👀 What does it do?
It always re-renders whenever state or props update — even if the value didn’t really change.

✅ When to use it?
When your component is simple

When performance is not a big deal

When the props or state are changing often

When you want full control over re-rendering

🔹 PureComponent – Smart Component
💡 What is it?
A special kind of class component. It automatically checks if props or state really changed.

👀 What does it do?
If the new value is the same as the old one, it won’t re-render. It helps your app run faster.

✅ When to use it?
When your component is used many times

When the props don’t change often

When you want to save performance

When working on big apps or tables/lists

🔄 Comparison Table
Feature	Component	PureComponent
Re-renders on props	✅ Always	✅ Only if changed
Performance	🐢 Slower (in big apps)	⚡ Faster (saves time)
Code simplicity	✅ Easy	✅ Easy but smarter
Good for	Small UI parts	Repeated or heavy parts

🧠 Real-World Example 1: Chat App (like Telegram)
Imagine you’re building a chat app.

🧩 Components:
Chat message (<Message />)

User info (<UserProfile />)

Side menu

✅ Use PureComponent for:
jsx
Copy
Edit
class Message extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.text}</p>;
  }
}
✅ Because chat messages don’t change once sent. So no need to re-render again and again.

🧠 Real-World Example 2: Product List (e.g., Amazon)
You have many <ProductCard /> components.

✅ Use PureComponent for each product:
jsx
Copy
Edit
class ProductCard extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
✅ Because if a product doesn’t change, there's no need to re-render.

❌ Don’t Use PureComponent When:
You’re dealing with nested props (deep objects)

Props change every second

You're not worried about performance

📌 REMEMBER
PureComponent does shallow compare:

It only checks if the first level of props/state changed.

If props are objects, it may not detect inner changes.

✅ Summary in Super Simple Words:
Word	Meaning
Component	Normal class component. Renders again even if nothing changed.
PureComponent	Smart class component. Renders only if something actually changed.
Use PureComponent when	You want better performance and your props don't change often
Use Component when	You're doing simple things or props change often

🔚 Final Advice
👉 In small projects or learning: use Component
👉 In big projects or repeated UI: prefer PureComponent
